      <p>
        When did my story with motorcycles begin? I loved riding bicycles from a very early age and as soon as I could pedal without stabilisers I would be riding my bike everywhere. I grew up in a small village in Surrey England. The nearest town of any size was a bus ride away so all the kids tended to stay in the village and the push bike was the best transport. I would literally ride it all day and into the night until late in the summer evenings. The first motorcycle I can remember paying any attention to was a Norton Commando owned by a chap at the top of our road. I remember cycling past it most days. It was bright red and immaculate with lots of chrome.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was about ten years old when an older boy that I knew who lived locally got a Suzuki TS50. All the local kids who knew him went to his house one sunny day to see this new bike. He lived on one of the posh roads and had a long back garden with a concrete path running up from the big lawn at the bottom. I guess he was about twelve or thirteen and knew how to ride the bike but I had never been on anything except my push bike. He was giving kids rides on the back up and down the long path and it then came to my turn. I was a little nervous but I climbed on to the back of the bike, no helmet! and off we went.
      </p>
      <p>
      At first just pootling around the lower lawn, but then up the long concrete path. The feeling was amazing. I was scared that I would fall off as we were pulled up the slight hill with what felt like amazing force at what seemed like crazy speed. I know it was only a 50cc bike but to me it was super fast. When we stopped, my heart racing, he asked if I would like to try riding it. I admit I was scared but there were other kids there and I did not want to lose face. Also I really wanted to give it a go.
